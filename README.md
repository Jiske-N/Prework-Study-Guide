# Prework Study Guide Webpage/Project

## Description

This is a working webpage that contains notes I took during the course prework and some questions that came up. 
The project was completed using and contains notes regarding the tools described in the precourse content to provide practice in their use and reinforce learning. 
Namely: 
+ HTML for the structure.
+ CSS for formating.
+ JavaScript for interaction and a look at developer tools.
+ As well as Gitbash to practice pushing/pulling to/from a local device and Github to host the project.  
  
By structuring everything together in one linked project it allowed an easier way to see the interaction between the different elements when compared to seperate "scenarios" or "problems" with each feature.

## Installation

No installation necessary.
A web browser and internet access are the only prerequisites for accessing the content.

## Usage

To view the Javascript elements: right or command click anywhere on the body and select "inspect" or "inspect element"
Then navigate to the console tab.
